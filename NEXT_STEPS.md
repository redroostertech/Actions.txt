# Next Steps / Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned enhancements and priorities for the ActionTxt Demo API project.  
It's intended for maintainers, contributors, and future planning.

## ðŸŽ‰ **Recently Completed (January 2025)**

We've successfully implemented a **production-ready reference server** that demonstrates the complete Action.txt specification:

### âœ… **Core Implementation**
- **Full OpenAPI 3.0.3 Compliance** - All endpoints implemented and tested
- **Authentication & Authorization** - OAuth2 Bearer tokens with scope validation
- **Rate Limiting** - Per-endpoint limits with Retry-After headers
- **Idempotency** - TTL-based storage with automatic cleanup
- **Security Middleware** - Helmet, CORS, and comprehensive error handling
- **Structured Logging** - Pino with request correlation and performance metrics

### âœ… **Documentation & Testing**
- **Complete API Documentation** - Working examples and local testing instructions
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Automated testing with `./test-server.sh`
- **Performance Characteristics** - <10ms response times, ~50MB memory usage
- **Developer Experience** - Environment templates, npm scripts, and working examples
